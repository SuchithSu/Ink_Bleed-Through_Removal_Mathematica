# Ink_Bleed-Through_Removal_Mathematica
Ink bleed occurs when the ink soaks through the piece of paper and thus reduces the legibility of the written documents on both sides of the paper.
In this project, a method is introduced using classical Image Processing techniques to improve the readability of such historical documents. The technique makes use of both the recto and verso sides of a page to remove bleed thorough degradation.
The problems faced include image registration, bleed through removal and readability enhancement on both sides of the pages.
